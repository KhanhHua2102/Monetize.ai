Project for Agile Web Development - CITS3403 unit at UWA 2023

Monetize.ai is a web-based chat bot application that utilizes the GPT-3.5 language model and integrates with the Yahoo Finance API to crawl financial data such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. The application is built using the Flask framework and SQLite for the database on the server side. The client side is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Bootstrap framework and jQuery for the client-side rendering.

The main objective of this project is to provide users with a personalized financial advisory service that can help them manage their investment portfolios in an efficient and effective manner. Users can declare their investment portfolios to the chat bot and receive advice on how to balance their portfolios using modern portfolio theory. The chat bot can also calculate profits/losses and provide other useful metrics related to the user's portfolio. All of the user's portfolio data is stored in the Portfolio section for future reference.

The Monetize.ai GitHub repository contains all the source code for the web-based application, including the chat bot implementation and the integration with the Yahoo Finance API. The application is built using Flask, a popular Python web framework, and the SQLite database for efficient and scalable data storage. The client-side rendering is done using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, making it easy to use and accessible across different devices.

The repository is organized into several modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application. The main module is the chat bot itself, which handles user queries and provides advice based on the user's portfolio data. Other modules include the Yahoo Finance API integration, database management, and modern portfolio theory calculations.

Monetize.ai is an open-source project, which means that anyone can contribute to it and help improve its functionality and features. The repository includes detailed documentation to help developers get started with the project and contribute code to it. There is also an active community of developers and users who can provide support and guidance on using the application.
